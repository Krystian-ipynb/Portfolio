    "# EGB103 Assignment One - Flight Simulator\n",
    "\n",
    "Programming and software play a crucial role in aiding engineers in problem-solving tasks such as understanding aerodynamics and the design and control of aircraft. These tools enable engineers to efficiently perform complex mathematical calculations, simulate dynamic behaviors, and visualize results. Through programming, engineers can automate repetitive tasks, implement sophisticated numerical methods and find optimal solutions to engineering design problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, to help you learn Python in the context of an Authentic Engineering problem, we will create a simple flight simulator. To keep things simple, our simulation will work only in 2D (longitudinally), i.e., the plane can climb and descend but not turn left or right. The *'pilot'* will therefore only have two input controls: the throttle that determines how much power the engine delivers to the propeller and the control yoke or stick that adjusts the angle of the horizontal stabilizer at the rear of the plane, thereby controlling the aircraft's pitch and enabling it to climb or descend.\n",

    "The aircraft that we will use as our primary model is the Tecnam P92, a single-engine, propeller-driven ultralight plane popular for flight training and recreational use. However, our simulation code will also work for other similar single-engine, propeller-driven aircraft models, including smaller Cessnas or Piper Cherokees.\n",

    "# About using Python Classes and Objects to Represent Aircraft\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't normally teach object-oriented programming in EGB103. However, for this particular assignment task, making use of a class makes our code a lot simpler and avoids the complexity of having dozens of global variables or passing dozens of parameters to each of our functions. We don't ask that you create any classes yourself, we provide the class definition (in tecnam.py), you just need to import the tecnam module and make use of it as explained below.\n",
    "\n",
    "We first need to introduce a few very basic object-oriented programming concepts. The TecnamP92 class (defined in the provided tecnam.py file) is designed to model the Tecnam P92 aircraft that we will be using as our primary test aircraft for our simulation. Tecnam is a company (an aircraft manufacturer) and the P92 is one of their more popular aircraft models. So our TecnamP92 class represents this *class* of aircraft. Each year Tecnam sells hundreds of P92s. Each of these individual aircraft are what well call *objects* that are *instances* of the TecnamP92 class. Each individual aircraft is typically identified by a tail number or call sign, for examine the \"Tecnam 7777\" might be one of our many Tecnam P92 aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the way we create an *object* (which is always an instance of some *class*) as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "tecnam7777 = TecnamP92()\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can then then create another distinct Tecnam P92 aircraft:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "tecnam3667 = TecnamP92()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: tecnam7777 and tecnam3667 are just regular python variables, we can name them whatever we like.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both of those aircraft will have some common *attributes*, such as a wing span of 9.3 metres (because all Tecnam P92's have the same wing span).\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since the tecnam7777 and the tecnam3667 are distinct aircraft, they might have some attributes that are different. For example, the tecnam7777 might currently be flying at 80 knots straight and level over Bribie Island, while the tecnam3667 might be waiting to takeoff on runway 07 at Redcliffe airport.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the way we access these attributes (both common and individual) is by using so called *'dot'* notation. \n",
    "For example:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "tecnam7777.wing_span\n",
    "tecnam3667.wing_span\n",
    "tecnam7777.propeller_diameter\n",
    "tecnam7777.position\n",
    "tecnam3667.engine_rpm\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can therefore think of these aircraft objects as *containers* for a collection of attributes related to a specific aircraft.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, we can both *read* and *update* the attributes of an object, for example:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "tecnam7777.throttle = 0.7 # use an assignment to update the value of the throttle attribute of this specific aircraft\n",
    "print(tecnam7777.mass) # read the mass of this aircraft\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, in the context of this assignment, you should **not** update/change any of the common/shared attributes that relate to all aircraft of that model, e.g. wing span. The only individual aircraft oriented attributes (that relate to the current state/location of a specific aircraft) that you are allowed to update/change via your functions are:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "time_elapsed\n",
    "position  \n",
    "angular_velocity  \n",
    "linear_velocity  \n",
    "pitch_angle_radians  \n",
    "engine_rpm  \n",
    "throttle  \n",
    "stabilizer_angle_radians  \n",
    "```\n",
    "(see below for explanations of each of these attributes and their initial values)\n",
    "\n",
    "Objects are just like any other Python value. You can store then in variables, or in lists, pass them as parameters to functions, or return them as the result of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our TecnamP92 class has some attributes which are not simple values, but rather functions. For example, to determine how much lift the wings of our Tecnam P92 will generate at a particular *angle of attack*, we can call the wing_lift_coefficient function associated with our TecnamP92 class as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "angle_of_attack = 0.2 # angle measured in radians\n",
    "coefficient = tecnam7777.wing_lift_coefficient(angle_of_attack)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see, its just like calling a regular python function, except that we need use the *'dot'* notation to access the wing_lift_coefficient function associated with that object (just like we would for any other attribute of that object).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can call:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "help(TecnamP92)\n",
    "```\n",
    "to get a detailed explanation of the TecnamP92 class and all of its attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "After you've read though that documentation, feel free to experiment below by creating objects of class TecnamP92 and reading and updating its attributes."

    "# How the Flight Simulator Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Our simulator will work in small discrete time steps. Each iteration of this process models how things change during a relatively small time period (or time delta) in the order of 0.01 seconds per time step. Fortunately, computers are able to perform thousands of these time step calculations per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modelling the Petrol Engine and Propeller interaction\n",
    "\n",
    "In each time step we start by modelling the interaction between the petrol driven piston engine and the propeller.\n",
    "The engine generates torque (the turning force that rotates its crankshaft). The amount of torque that it can generate depends on the current RPM of the engine and the throttle position. Each engine has a unique torque curve. The Tecnam P92 has a Rotax 912 engine that generates a maximum torque of 128 Newton metres when at 5100 rpm and max throttle.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/rotax912torque_curve.jpg\" alt=\"Torque curve for Rotax 912 Engine\" style=\"width:400px; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto\">\n",
    "\n",
    "At other engine RPM rates and lower throttle values it produces less torque. We can use the <code>TecnamP92.engine_torque</code> method which takes two parameters, current engine rpm and throttle to get an estimated torque value for our Tecnam's Rotax engine. \n",
    "\n",
    "The propeller generates thrust force which has the effect of propelling the aircraft forward. The propeller does this by exerting a force on the air entering the propeller that causes that air to be accelerated back through the propeller. By pushing against the air in this way, the aircraft is propelled forward. The air passing through the propeller, however exerts an equal and opposite force on the propeller. That force tends to cause the propeller rate of rotation to slow, i.e. the air imparts a torque load on the propeller which acts to decelerate the propeller's angular velocity. The propeller is connected to the engine via a fixed gearing ratio (which in the case of the Tecnam P92 is 1:2.43). That means if the engine is rotating at 5800 rpm, then the propeller will be rotating at 5800/2.42 rpm (approximately 2387 rpm). This direct (geared) connection between the propeller and the engine also means that the propeller then exerts a torque load on the engine that generally acts to try to reduce the rpm of the engine. However, because of the gearing, if the torque load on the propeller is say 30 Newton metres, then the torque load transferred to the engine will be only 30/2.43 = 12.4 Nm.\n",
    "If we know the torque currently generated by the engine and the torque load imparted on the engine, then the difference between these two quantities will be the net or excess torque. If the net/excess torque is positive then it accelerates the RPM of the engine (i.e. cause the engine RPM to increase). If the net/excess torque is negative then the RPM of the engine will decrease. To compute the angular acceleration (rate of change of RPM) we divide the net torque by the engine's Moment of Inertia. The engine's moment of inertia is a measure of how the mass of the crank shaft and related components is distributed and is an indication of how much *'effect'* is required to rotate it. The resulting  angular acceleration is measured in radians per second per second. We are only modelling what happens during one small time step which may be much less than one second. So to determine the change in engine angular velocity, we apply this angular acceleration rate for only that time delta. However, that change in angular velocity is still  measured in radians per second, so we need to then convert it to rotations per minute to determine the increase in engine RPM.\n",

We can use the <code>TecnamP92.propeller_torque_coefficient</code> method to estimate this coefficient. The torque coefficient depends on an input parameter J  which is the advance rate given by the equation below. The advance rate captures the ratio of the current airspeed to the current rotational speed of the propeller. At higher advance rates the airspeed becomes so high the the blades start to struggle to create much acceleration on the air through the propeller. The torque coefficient is therefore highest at an advance rate of zero when the aircraft is stationary and then decreases with higher advance rates.\n",

    "Our aircraft's wing and also its rear stabilizer are both examples of aerofoils, which are shapes designed  to generate lift when air flows over them. An aerofoil generates lift by creating a pressure difference between its upper and lower surfaces as air flows over it. The faster-moving air over the curved upper surface reduces pressure, while the slower-moving air under the lower surface maintains higher pressure. This pressure difference results in an upward lifting force, often referred to as the \"Bernoulli force.\" According to Bernoulli's principle, a decrease in pressure within a *'fluid'* flow results in an acceleration of the fluid, which helps explain how an aerofoil generates lift.\n",

The direction of the relative airflow is simply opposite the direction the aircraft is currently heading, which can be determined from its current linear velocity.

Given the current net force (which is a 2D vector) and the mass of the aircraft we can use Newton's Second Law of Motion (Linear  acceleration equation below) to compute the aircraft's new acceleration (which is also a 2D vector). When can then use that new acceleration to compute the aircraft's new linear velocity (also a 2D vector) by applying that acceleration for the time delta for one time step (Update Linear velocity equation below).

We refer to the current angle of rotation as the aircraft's pitch angle. A pitch angle of $0$ degrees means the fuselage of the aircraft is level with the horizonal. A pitch angle of $45$ degrees means the nose of the aircraft is above the rear of the aircraft (we refer to this as a nose-up attitude, where the terms pitch and attitude are used somewhat interchangeably).\n",

    "When computing the net force that affects the movement of the aircraft as a whole we can ignore where on the aircraft the forces are applied. However, when considering the rotational motion of the aircraft about its centre we need to consider where the forces are applied and in which direction they are applied as that will determine whether those forces exert a moment that will tend to cause the aircraft to rotate around  its centre of gravity. For example the gravitational force is effectively applied at the aircraft's centre of gravity, so it affects the aircraft's linear motion but not its angular motion.  The two key forces that create rotational moments are the aerodynamic forces created by the wing and rear stabilizer. To calculate a specific moment we need to consider the moment arm, an imaginary line from the centre of rotation (i.e. centre of gravity) to the point where the force is applied. We then need to decompose that force into two components, a component that acts tangential to that moment arm and a component that acts parallel to the moment arm. It is only the tangential component of the force that will contribute to moment. To compute the moment we also need to know the length of this moment arm. The longer the moment arm, the more leverage it exerts (see equation below).\n",

In that case one of the moments will be positive and the other will be negative. At other times they might both be acting to create rotation in the same direction (either pitch up or pitch down). To compute the net moment acting on the aircraft we simply add these two numbers. We can then use that current net moment to compute the new angular acceleration that it produces by dividing by the plane's moment of inertia (see Angular Acceleration equation below). For linear motion the acceleration that results from a given force depends on the object's mass, while for angular motion, the angular acceleration that results from a given moment depends on the objects's moment of inertia. Once we have the aircraft's new angular acceleration we can updates its new angular velocity by applying that angular acceleration for the given time delta (see Update Angular Velocity equation below). And finally, we can use that new angular velocity to update the aircraft's new angular position (i.e. pitch angle) by applying that angular velocity for the given time delta (see Update Pitch Angle equation below).

    "When the aircraft is on the ground (represented by an altitude of zero), the gravitational force down is going to countered by an equal and opposite force from the earth that prevents the aircraft from dropping below the surface of the earth. The same is true if the plane crash lands from a height, it can't fall below the surface of the earth. We therefore need to implement these ground effects as a special case if the altitude is currently zero (or less). We also assume that while the aircraft is on the ground (typically sitting flat during takeoff and landing) that the front wheel is positioned far enough forward that it prevents the aircraft from rotating further forward.
